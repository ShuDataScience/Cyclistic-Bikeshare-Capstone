# Cyclistic-Bikeshare-Capstone

Context: 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. 

The fictional company is called Cyclistic. The marketing leadership believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team (data analytics) wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The goal for the analysis is: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

In order to do that, I will analyze behaviours of both causal riders and annual members, identify the difference/ trends and make recommendations on how digital media could affect their target customers.  

The three key recommendations for the marketing campaign are from where to select campaign location, how to better target the customers and seasonality and day of week  standpoint.    

1. From the location perspective: 
The marketing campaign (i.e. rolling ads at the stations) can prioritize the most popular 7 locations, where the campaign will target more users, and more targeted customers.

2. From the target customers (casual riders) perspective: 
Provide more marketing campaign visibility (i.e. billboard footage, rolling ads frequency) at docked bike stations. The users are 100% targeted customers.
Digital advertisement and email campaign can be used to this group of users too. 

3. From the seasonality and day of the week perspective:
  
    a. Jun-Oct are the peak seasons. I recommend to increase budget spent in these months. The marketing campaingn will be viewed by more targeted customers (casual users). Digital advertisement and email campaign frequency can be increased.
  
    b. The casual users are more active (by 40% roughly) at the weekend. Increasing the marketing campaingn at the weekend, can increase the campaign exporsure to casual riders hence increase the potential convertion rate from casual riders to annual memebers.

Findings: 

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
1. Both types of users have a similar trend in trip duration: the duration is longer at the weekend. Tuesday- Thursday are the shortest. 
2. Casual riders' average trip duration is around 2 times of the member's. 
3. Members do not rent bikes for over 1.5 days. The long (>1.5 days) duration trips are contributed 100% by casual riders.
4. Usages throughout the week differs between casual rider and members. Casuals riders' usage at the weekend are significantly higher than working days, while members have less demand at the weekend. 
5. All the docked_bike users are casual riders.
6. Casual users are more active (by 40% roughly) at the weekend.
7. The most used start and end stations perfectly overlap. The top 7 stations are: 13022, LF-005,13042, 13000,TA1308000050, 13008, TA1308000050.
