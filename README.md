# Cyclistic-Bikeshare-Capstone

Context: 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers,  there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. 

The fiction company is called Cyclistic. The marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The goal for the analysis is: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

In order to do that, I will analyze behaviours of both causal riders and annual members, identify the difference/ trends and make recommendations on how digital media could affect their target customers.  

Consumer Behavior Findings: 

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
1. Both types of users have a similar trend in trip duration: The duration is longer at the weekend. Tuesday- Thursday are the shortest. 
2. Casual riders' average trip duration is around 2 times of the member's. 
3. Members do not rent bikes for over 1.5 days. The long duration trips are by casual riders.
4. The casual riders and members' demand ranges differently in days. Casuals riders' demand at the weekend are significantly higher than working days, while members have less demand at the weekend. 
5. All the docked_bike users are casual riders.

General Findings: 
1. The analysis shows that casual users are more active (by 40% roughly) at the weekend.
2. From the analysis, the most used start and end stations perfectly overlap. The top 7 stations are: 13022, LF-005,13042, 13000,TA1308000050, 13008, TA1308000050.  

The three key recommendations for the marketing campaign: 

1.From the location perspective: 
The marketing campaign can prioritize the most popular 7 locations, where the campaign will target more users, and more targeted customers.

2. From the target customers perspective: 
Provide more marketing campaign visibility (footage, frequency) at docked_bike stations. The users are 100% targeted customers.

3. From the time perspective:

  a. Jun-Oct are the peak seasons. I recommend to increase budget spent in these months. The marketing campaingn will be viewed by more more target customers.
   
  b. The casual users are more active (by 40% roughly) at the weekend. Increasing the marketing campaingn at the weekend, can increase the campaign exporsure to casual users to increase the potential converation rate to memebers.
